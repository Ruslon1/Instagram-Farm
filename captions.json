    "A rotor engine, also known as a rotary engine or Wankel engine, is a type of internal combustion engine that uses a rotary design to convert pressure into rotational motion, instead of the traditional reciprocating piston mechanism. It features a triangular rotor that rotates within an epitrochoidal-shaped housing, completing the intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust cycles in a seamless manner. This design allows for a compact size, smooth operation, and fewer moving parts compared to conventional piston engines, resulting in reduced vibration and maintenance. However, rotor engines are less fuel-efficient and tend to emit higher levels of pollutants. Despite these drawbacks, their high power-to-weight ratio and compactness make them ideal for specific applications, such as in Mazda sports cars and small aircraft.",
    "TDI stands for Turbocharged Direct Injection, a technology used in diesel engines that combines a turbocharger with direct fuel injection to improve power, efficiency, and emissions. Developed primarily by Volkswagen Group, TDI engines are known for their excellent torque output, making them ideal for vehicles requiring strong pulling power. They achieve high fuel efficiency by injecting fuel directly into the combustion chamber and using turbocharging to boost air intake, resulting in better combustion. However, TDI engines have been scrutinized for emissions compliance, especially following the 'Dieselgate' scandal.",
    "A car compressor, commonly associated with air conditioning systems, is a mechanical device responsible for pressurizing and circulating refrigerant to enable heat exchange and cool the cabin. It operates as the heart of the A/C system, driven by the engine via a belt. Compressors come in various designs, such as rotary, scroll, and piston types, and their efficiency directly impacts the cooling performance of the vehicle. Regular maintenance is crucial to prevent leaks and ensure consistent operation.",
    "Torque is a measure of rotational force applied to an object, typically measured in Newton-meters (Nm) or pound-feet (lb-ft). In automotive terms, it represents the force that an engine generates to rotate the vehicle's wheels, significantly impacting acceleration and towing capacity. Higher torque at lower RPMs enhances drivability, especially in heavy vehicles or during uphill driving, making it a critical factor in evaluating engine performance.",
    "Michelin Pilot Sport 4 is a high-performance summer tire designed for sports cars and premium sedans, offering exceptional grip, precise steering, and reliable braking performance. It features an innovative tread pattern with optimized grooves to improve water evacuation, reducing the risk of hydroplaning. With Michelin's dynamic response technology and silica-based compounds, the Pilot Sport 4 provides outstanding handling on both dry and wet surfaces while ensuring durability and a comfortable ride.",
    "The brake system in a car is a critical safety component that allows the driver to slow down or stop the vehicle. It typically consists of a hydraulic system with disc or drum brakes, brake pads, calipers, rotors, and brake fluid. Modern systems often include advanced features like anti-lock braking systems (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), and regenerative braking in electric vehicles. Regular maintenance, such as replacing brake pads and checking fluid levels, ensures the system functions reliably and efficiently.",
    "Venture investment refers to the funding provided to early-stage startups and companies with high growth potential by venture capitalists or investment firms. These investments are typically exchanged for equity in the company and are aimed at fostering innovation and scaling operations. Venture investments are high-risk but can yield substantial returns if the business succeeds, playing a vital role in driving entrepreneurship and technological advancements.",
    "A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. It uses convolutional layers to extract spatial features, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification or regression tasks. CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks like image recognition, object detection, and segmentation, thanks to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations.",
    "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of deep learning architecture designed for sequential data processing, such as time series, text, or speech. RNNs have loops in their structure, allowing information to persist across time steps, making them ideal for tasks like language modeling and video analysis. Variants like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) address issues like vanishing gradients, enabling the model to capture long-term dependencies in data.",
    "Attention mechanisms in neural networks prioritize certain parts of the input data by assigning weights to different elements, helping the model focus on relevant information. First introduced in natural language processing, attention is now a key component in many architectures, such as transformers, where it enables effective handling of long-range dependencies. By dynamically adjusting focus during training, attention mechanisms improve the model's performance in tasks like translation, summarization, and image captioning.",
    "Transformers are a deep learning architecture based on attention mechanisms, revolutionizing fields like natural language processing and computer vision. They consist of encoder and decoder layers that process input and output sequences using self-attention and feedforward networks. Transformers eliminate the need for sequential processing found in RNNs, enabling parallelization and faster training. Popularized by models like BERT and GPT, they excel in tasks like translation, text generation, and image analysis.",
